# Notes on week 1 - Whats AI
1. Differences between ANI and AGI
  - Artificatil narrow intelligence - smart speakers, self-driving cars
  - Artificatil general intelligence - basically to be as smart as a human
1. Machine learning
  - Supervised learning - Finding mappings between inputs to outputs. 
  - Data 
    - Usually a table of information
    - Labeling data - Identifying an attribute value to an item of the data. It can be manual or can it be derived based on the data it self
    - How to use data the wrong way 
      - The discussion between I will collect data and then analize it many years down the road. 
    Its best to start analysing the data right away because you can learn sooner about the data and make piviots if needed
      - More data doesnt mean its the best. Its possible that this data doesnt provide any value or lacks perspective.
    - Data is messy or incorrect. There can be cleaning of data or incorrect data that can throw off the AI.
      - Structured data in tables or unstructured data like text 
  - Terms
    - Machine Learning - basically there are inputs and it splits out outputs. Usually an algorithm
    - Data Science - coming up with hypothisis , run test to support the hypotisis or dispove. Usually lots of documents to support the algorithm in a way to drive information or ideas like business insights
    - Deep learning - Artifical neual network. Takes many inputs to come up with an output. Add screenshot of neural network. Neral netowek is not like the human brain in nerons
  - whats an ai company
