# What is AI? (and what it isn't)
AI can be a mysterious thing for almost anyone. Based on movies it could take over the world
and control everyone. It can instantly heal people or solve the hardest problems for a human. 
Some of this could potentially be real but many years to come with research. 

This article will be an overview of the "Ai For Everyone" course at Coursera by Andrew NG. This course a high level overview seemly geared towards executives to companies. He also created the Machine learning MOOC course with Stanford University which has seen 2.8 million sign ups. 

## General overview of AI
In the AI world today there are two different kinds of AI. Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI) and Artificial General Intelligence(AGI). The majority of todays research is in ANI. ANI examples would be in smart speakers or self-driving cars where AGI is trying to accomplish a system that's as smart as humans  in all aspects. ANI tries to focus on a specific or set of small specific problems to solve. 

Another topic in the world of AI is Machine Learning(ML). Boiling down ML to the most simple thing is having build a model with many inputs to come up with an output. Within ML we have different subsets called Supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning has information in the data to help key off of what's desired which makes starting out with Supervised learning to be a little be easier. Where as Unsupervised learning can need a considerable amount more data to train the models to the desired state. 

Data is a large part of AI and ML as that's what's used to train and come up with the models. Sometimes the data will have a nice organized format where it can be labeled. labeled data is helpful for Supervised learning but we have to make sure the data is clean. Clean data usually means that its organized in a way that computers can parse it easily and that there are any missing or incorrect information in the data set. Cleaning data can be a large portion of a Data Scientist job(which I will go into later in this article).

An extremely hot topic right now is Deep Learning. Deep learning is an artificial neural network that takes man inputs to come up with an output. Similar to machine learning but the neural network creates some and weights some hidden attibutes automatically that might be obvious to the user. Below we can see a basic example of a Deep learning system.

The final intro topic relating to AI is Data Science. A simple way to put is a data scientist will come up with hypothesis and run test to prove out the hypothesis. With the results a data scientist will most likely create reports around this to present to an audience which will help drive information or ideas like business insights.

## What can AI do?
A simple rule of thumb can be if a human can do a tasks within a few seconds, then an AI task can most likely accomplish this task. For example would be taking an audio file and converting it to a textual format. An example of what AI cant not currently do is tasked to do some market research and come up with a 50 page analysis report. 

## Detailed AI
This section will dive into more about ML, AI and Data science

Some simple steps for ML project would be the following:
1. collect data
2. train a model
3. deploy a model
4. 
For Machine Learning there could be a model build where you feed in resumes and it will classify if the person should be a candidate to be interviewed. This can be challenging in the case that the model potential could be biased depending on the model development.

Some simple steps for Data Science project would be the following:
1. Collect data
2. Analyze the data
3. Suggest a hypotheses or some kind of action or back to step 1 or 2

Data science can be used to analyze the recruiting funnel to view each step. Based on that analysis you can make recommendations to how to improve the recruiting funnel. Over time that data can help make educated decision

Interesting point discussion about AI replacing jobs, Andrew discusses that we should consider breaking down a job into many tasks. These tasks could be more efficient for an AI to to but possibility an AI to do all of the tasks might not make sense. 


## How can you use AI
Before you get started with an AI team, a  key aspect is to think about what business value this project will provide. A start would be to look for pain points in the current system and see if AI can help solve those problems. Andrew Ng says that we dont really need huge dataset to use AI as its possible to try to leverage small data sets to prove out ideas. Two aspects to think about before kicking off an AI project. One that the project is feasible to understand that technically it can be done. Second that the project is valuable to the business.

Build vs buy conundrum - Machine learning usually buy could be faster up front but maybe not as flexible. Data Science usually all done in house

## AI Transformation
The following are a set of steps that Andrew Ng suggest when trying to add AI into a business.

1. Pilot Projects - Consider trying to make simple projects that would be successful. Trying to gain momentum. 
2. Set up infrastructure - Company's can then take the lessons learned from the pilot projects and set up standardization around data warehousing. This is important to streamline and AI projects. Consider using an AI team and matrix them into different organizations. This will allow the AI members to work with the domain experts. Consider having the company to provide funding first vs having the business units to provide funding
3. Training - Ensure that the teams are adequately training to perform the tasks of these new roles and even managers so they have an awareness to the projects
4. Strategy - As many good projects and ventures go, setting up a good strategy to allow the whole team to understand what the road map will look like. Its sometimes important to not come up with a strategy up front because it might be academic in nature and might not lean well towards the consumer or project. this is epically good if you or your team is new to this concept.
5. Communication - Ensure that everyone within the project is on the same page as well as how teams are communication to the outside teams so they dont have any contradictions. 
## AI Pitfalls
- Make sure not have high expectations that AI is going to solve all of your problems but understand that AI can be a great leveraging tool if you use it well
- Its recommended to hiring a set of ML Engineers that should to be paired up with domain experts 
 - AI is an iterative process so make sure you dont set high expectations up front as it can take time to get a situated

## AI controversy 
When looking a AI, use the goldilocks rule to just set your expectations level. Bing too optimistic to super AI and that it will take over the world can be considered a waste of energy since there is not a clear path anything like that soon. Bing too pessimistic such as AI can’t do anything so why bother with it about how another AI winter is coming. At that time in past for AI winter it was hyped up too much and didn't bring much value at the time. Today AI is bringing economic value so it’s not over hyped. 

Sometimes AI is look down upon because it can’t explain itself on how it made its decisions.

There have been studies that have been found that AIs have parsed some data from online to build some relationships and found that it can be bias. For example if you told AI man to woman as Father it would come up Mother. A bias example was Man to Computer programmer as Woman would come up with homemaker which is not a good representation. 

Hiring company created an AI tool and found that it was picking a select demographic. This tool was later decommission due to the bias.

An idea to solve this would be to use inclusive data or less biased data. Also having some audition processes such as having different types of training sets to ensure that the system is staying unbiased. 

Its possible to add some data that doesn't look obvious to a human, but it throws off the AI by a lot. We have an example here were some pixels were changed and AI is not classifying this as a hammer where it should be a hummingbird. An example below how this might work:

DeepFakes - AI used to make people look like they said something when they really didn't. Buzzfeed posted a video of Obama of the first one that became popular but also said he was fake. [Obama - DeepFake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0)

# AI for the good
Many people are concerned that AI will take over their jobs. That can be a real thing in some cases but in general its more likely that AI will generate more jobs than it will cut. The concept would be to have AI automate some of the lower end jobs but to use that economic savings to help leapfrog people upward on the economic ladder. Example would be Mobile payments, in some countries such as Indian, they didn't bother building all the landlines, instead they focused on building the wireless infrastructural to support wireless communication. 

McKenney Global Institute did a study that estimated that between 400-800 million jobs would be displaced but on the flip side they found that AI would generate between 555-890 million jobs. Usually jobs that have routines have high likely that AI could impact. Some suggested solutions would be to have lifelong learning society or a conditional basic income to help provide a safety net but incentive learning.

# Conclusion
Overall AI if leveraged well can be an empowering tool to help drive efficiency and help optimize how we operate. Its really excited seeing so much development and enthusiasm in the field today. I look forward to seeing how the future goes in the directions in ANI, Deep learning, Data Science and so much more.
