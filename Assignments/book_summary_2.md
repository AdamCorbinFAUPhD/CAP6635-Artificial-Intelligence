6:10 - 5 different tribes 

Each of these tribes have their own master algo. Meaning if you give it enough data it can learn anything. 

## Symbolists
 Think of leanring of the inverse of deduction. Specific Facts to general rules. Boil this down to we can take the inverse of additon (subtraction) to find the solution. For example 2 - ? =4. and we know 2+2 = 4 so the ? must be 2. Using this kind of logic we could try to figure out things using inverse deductin. Based on this theory, you could start with simple problems and build up to complex things that a human may never have ever thought of. The questions get put into First order logic(whats that?) and with chaining other logic conditions you can come up with solutions. Eve is a bilogise robot that uses this theory to develop reasoning techniquetst. It discovered a new malaria drug!
 
 ## Connectionist
 Thinks that the symbolists its too abstrack, too much logis, not close enough like how humans think. Comes up with trying to find how the brain works and use that to the advange to solve problems. Back propogations. Nural networks/deep learning. build a matamaticl modle how a the brain works which we call a nuron. Add many of these together to build a "small brain".  How to train a whole network? For example how to do figure out what node in the middle of this mesh caused the problem if the result is not correct. This is called the credit assignment problem. You can use back propogation to sovle this problem. Take the current out put and the desired output to find the difference. Then state the problem, what needs to change i order to get closer to the desired output. From there we move back 1 layer ask the same question of expected output to current output. By adjusting the weithts you can retuce the error to closer to whats desired
 
 ## Evolutionaries
 They discuss that the brain comes from evolution. Using evolutionary learning, generic algotithms, generic programming area.
